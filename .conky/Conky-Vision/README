#----------- MOVING THE CONKY -----------#

	In order to move the conky around open the ".conkyrc" file and find the "gap_x" and "gap_y" lines.By manipulating these numbers you can move the conky around.
	
	Also, this conky has the "alignment" value set to "middle_middle" by default.
	This means that the conky will be centered on your screen.To move it around you can also use negative values for "gap_x" and "gap_y"(e.g., gap_x -60), or you can comment the alignment value out(add a "#" in front of it).
