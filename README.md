# my-rc-files
Contains my rc files

Run **./.myscripts/add_rc.sh** to stage new changes.

**Basic requirements** (assuming standard installations already present):

1. Curl for Vundle.
2. Vundle (use git clone).
3. Powerline fonts (for Linux/Unix based systems for airline, included in this repo, just change the terminal font.).
4. create-ap package for WiFi hotspot.

**Contents:**

1. i3 config (A good way to start with i3 would be to look at things you can do in your config).
2. vimrc with plugins handled with Vundle. Run ':PluginInstall' after cloning in vim to pull all plugins. That's it.
3. zshrc (uses oh-my-zsh but only custom-selected portions to speed up) and a bashrc with aliases indispensible to me.
4. Conky vision config for an awesome looking transparent conky. (not mine)
5. A varied variety of self written scripts to do day to day tasks.
6. A script to create a new WiFi hotspot (edit the script for custom ssid and password).
7. Conky status bar config for i3.
8. i3status status bar for i3.
9. Powerline fonts for Airline plugin in vim to work. Try switching to any of the the powerline fonts in terminal to see the effect.
10. Touchegg configuration for a decent touchpad gesture list for Unity (depreciated).

The i3 and Vim portion is documented on my website at http://acehack.org
